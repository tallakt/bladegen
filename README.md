# bladegen

Generate propeller blades in OpenSCAD.

Note the propellers and turbine blades generated by this code is not at all
tested in real life scenarios and may be totally wrong.


## Installation

To use bladegen, you should put the `bladegen` folder from the git `libraries`
folder to the OpenSCAD library folder that you will find in the `File` menu of
OpenSCAD. Additionally you will need to install the DiscreteOpenSCAD library
[BOSL2](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2) also in the library folder.



## Usage

```openscad
use <bladegen/bladegen.scad>

CIRCLE = [[3, 0], [2.42705, 1.76336], [0.927051, 2.85317], [-0.927051, 2.85317], [-2.42705, 1.76336], [-3, 0], [-2.42705, -1.76336], [-0.927051, -2.85317], [0.927051, -2.85317], [2.42705, -1.76336]];

translate([0, 0, 0]) bladegen_inch(pitch = 4, diameter = 5, outline = ["rectangular"]);
translate([0, 25, 0]) bladegen_inch(pitch = 4, diameter = 5, outline = ["trapez", 0.5]);
translate([0, 50, 0]) bladegen_inch(pitch = 4, diameter = 5, outline = ["elliptical"]);
translate([0, 75, 0]) bladegen_inch(pitch = 4, diameter = 5, outline = ["squarish"]);
translate([0, 100, 0]) bladegen_mm(pitch = 100, diameter = 100, outline = ["rectangular"], aspect = 3);
translate([0, 125, 0]) bladegen_mm(diameter = 100, outline = ["rectangular"], inner_radius = 10);
translate([0, 150, 0]) bladegen_mm(ccw = true, diameter = 100, outline = ["rectangular"], inner_radius = 10);
translate([0, 175, 0]) bladegen_mm(diameter = 100, outline = ["rectangular"], inner_radius = 20, root_shape = [CIRCLE, 10]);
translate([0, 200, 0]) bladegen_mm(turbine = true, diameter = 100, outline = ["rectangular"], inner_radius = 10);
translate([0, 275, 0]) bladegen_mm(diameter = 100, outline = ["elliptical"], inner_radius = 10, blades = 5);
```

If you prefer, open the file `demo.scad` to run the above commands.

All inch lengths and pitch are specified in inces, while the metric version
expects meters.

To make a hub, it must be done manually by a code something like


```openscad
include <BOSL2/std.scad>
use <bladegen/bladegen.scad>

difference() {
  union() {
    root_shape = [right(3, yflip(oval(r = [3, 8], $fn = 30))), 10];
    up(3) bladegen_mm(diameter = 200, inner_radius = 20, blades = 5, naca_n = 10, root_shape = root_shape);
    cyl(r = 15, h = 10); // note slight overlap due to curvature
  }
  cyl(d = 6, h = 99);
}
```

This code also demontrates ending the blade near the root, though being quite
flaky to achieve.
