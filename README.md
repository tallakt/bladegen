# bladegen

Generate propeller blades in OpenSCAD.

![Demo script output](images/demo.png)

What can it do?

- Create propeller blades
- Use any four digit NACA profiles
- Specify size and pitch
- Specify elliptical lift outline or trapezoidal outlines
- Make propeller or turbine blades
- Finish the blade at the root
- The blades can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise
- You can specify the aspect ratio of the blade
- You can specify different wing profiles for each blade section, with
  interpolation
- You can plug in your own outline
- Specify accuracy for quick or precise output


Note the propellers and turbine blades generated by this code is not at all
tested in real life scenarios and may be totally wrong, though probably they
are ok.


## Installation

To use bladegen, you should put the `bladegen` folder from the git `libraries`
folder to the OpenSCAD library folder that you will find in the `File` menu of
OpenSCAD. Additionally you will need to install the DiscreteOpenSCAD library
[BOSL2](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2) also in the library folder.



## Usage

```openscad
use <bladegen/bladegen.scad>

INCH_MM = 25.6;


translate([0, 0, 0])   bladegen(pitch = 4 * INCH_MM, diameter = 5 * INCH_MM);
translate([0, 25, 0])  bladegen(pitch = 4 * INCH_MM, diameter = 5 * INCH_MM, outline = rectangular_outline());
translate([0, 50, 0])  bladegen(pitch = 4 * INCH_MM, diameter = 5 * INCH_MM, outline = rectangular_outline(taper_tip = 0.5));
translate([0, 75, 0])  bladegen(pitch = 4 * INCH_MM, diameter = 5 * INCH_MM, outline = elliptical_outline(exponent = 2));
translate([0, 100, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, outline = elliptical_outline(aspect_ratio = 3));
translate([0, 125, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, nodes = blade_nodes(inner_radius = 0.10));
translate([0, 150, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, ccw = true);
translate([0, 175, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, nodes = blade_nodes(inner_radius = 0.30), root = ellipse_root(radius = 0.1));
translate([0, 200, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, turbine = true);
translate([0, 225, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, wing_sections = [[0.0, 2440], [0.5, 2420], [1.0, 0010]]);
translate([0, 300, 0]) bladegen(pitch = 40, diameter = 100, nodes = blade_nodes(inner_radius = 0.15), blades = 5);
```

If you prefer, open the file `demo.scad` to run the above commands.

All inch lengths and pitch are specified in inces, while the metric version
expects meters.

To make a hub, it must be done manually by a code something like


```openscad
use <bladegen/bladegen.scad>

diameter = 200;
hub_r = 15;
hub_h = 12;
hole_d = 6;

nodes = blade_nodes(inner_radius = 0.3);
root = ellipse_root(r = [0.2, 0.08], rotate = 40.0, radius = 0.10);

difference() {
  union() {
    bladegen(diameter = 200, pitch = 150, nodes = nodes, root = root, blades = 5);
    translate([0, 0, -1]) cylinder(r = hub_r, h = hub_h, center = true);
  }
  cyl(d = hole_d, h = 99, center = true, $fn = 30);
}
```

This code also demontrates ending the blade near the root, though being quite
flaky to achieve.
